# Unity Engine — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | Unity 6.6 (editor 6000.6.7f1, Oct 21, 2026) |
| **Installed at pin time** | 6000.6.7f1 at /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.6.7f1 (only editor installed; checked 2026-11-01) |
| **Release Date** | September 2026 (6.6); previous pin 6.3 LTS, December 2025 |
| **Latest editor on the pinned line** | 6000.3.26f1 (Oct 8, 2026) |
| **Project Pinned** | 2026-11-01 (6.6; was 6.3 LTS from 2026-02-13) |
| **Last Docs Verified** | 2026-11-01 (6.3 LTS → 6.6 sections in breaking-changes, deprecated-apis, current-best-practices; latest 6.6 editor); 2026-10-17 (release timeline); 2026-02-13 (rest of directory) |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |

## Knowledge Gap Warning

The LLM's training data likely covers Unity up to ~2022 LTS (2022.3). The entire
Unity 6 release series (formerly Unity 2023 Tech Stream) introduced significant
changes that the model does NOT know about. Always cross-reference this directory
before suggesting Unity API calls.

## Installed-Version Gap Warning

The warning above is one-directional — it covers the **model** knowing less than
this pin. The reverse gap is real and `/setup-engine` §3 creates it deliberately
("pin the newer one and upgrade later"): this reference can sit **ahead of the
installed editor**, and an agent citing it correctly then emits APIs that do not
compile locally. **Check `Installed at pin time` above before trusting a
version-qualified claim** — `NOT DETERMINED` means the gap is unknown, not absent.

## Post-Cutoff Version Timeline

| Version | Release | Risk Level | Key Theme |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 6.2 | Aug 2025 | MEDIUM | Supported Update release: Unity AI (beta) in the Editor, Mesh LOD, World Space UI for UI Toolkit, Graph Toolkit, Android XR hand mesh |
| 6.3 LTS | Dec 2025 | HIGH | First LTS since 6.0 (two years of support): Platform Toolkit, Nintendo Switch 2 support, Android XR, desktop screen reader support, Shader Build Settings |

## Newer Releases After the Pin (6.4 to 6.7)

**2026-11-01: the project now pins Unity 6.6** (a Supported Update release, not LTS;
supported until 6.7 ships). The 6.4–6.6 changes are recorded under `## 6.3 LTS → 6.6`
in breaking-changes.md, deprecated-apis.md and current-best-practices.md, each
claim sourced to Unity's What's new / upgrade-guide pages. Not sourceable from those
pages: 3D PhysX changes and Netcode for GameObjects changes. Plan `/setup-engine upgrade`
when 6.7 LTS ships. 6.0 LTS support ends in October 2026.

| Version | Release | Status (2026-10-17) | Key Theme |
|---------|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| 6.4 | Mar 2026 | Reached end of life | ECS (Entities, Collections, Mathematics, Entities Graphics) ships as Core packages, Project Auditor built into the Editor, DirectStorage on Windows, `EntityId` replaces `InstanceID`, URP Compatibility Mode removed in favor of Render Graph |
| 6.5 | Jun 2026 | Reached end of life | Entity unification (`InstanceID` to `EntityId`), Editor Lifecycle API toward a CoreCLR Editor, 2D (custom lights and shadows, `RenderSprite` API, Physics Core 2D), on-tile post-processing for mobile, Built-In Render Pipeline deprecated |
| 6.6 | Sep 2026 | **Pinned 2026-11-01.** Supported until 6.7 ships; latest editor 6000.6.7f1 (Oct 21, 2026) | Final supported release of the Unity 6 family: Play Mode skips domain reloads by default for new projects, Content Directories, Build Analysis window, WebGPU as a production Web option |
| 6.7 | Beta | Not released | 6000.7.0b1 on Sep 17, 2026, latest 6000.7.0b5 on Oct 15, 2026; Unity's 6.6 post calls it the 6.7 LTS |

Dates and status, verified 2026-10-17: 6.4 (announced Mar 17, 2026; editor
6000.4.0f1 Mar 18) https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-6-4-is-now-available/1713245
and https://docs.unity.com/en-us/engine/6000.6/manual/whats-new/unity64; 6.5
(Jun 15, 2026) https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-6-5-is-now-available/1723176
and https://docs.unity.com/en-us/engine/6000.5/manual/whats-new/unity65; 6.6
(editor 6000.6.0f1 Aug 31, announced Sep 1, 2026, latest 6000.6.6f1 Oct 15)
https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-6-6-is-now-available/1735357. The 6.4 and
6.5 threads carry the banner "This supported release has reached end of life"
(6.4 points to 6.5 or above, 6.5 to 6.6 or above); the 6.6 post says it is
supported "until the next release - in this case 6.7 - arrives" and that it
"brings you one step closer to the 6.7 LTS". Editor versions and release dates
come from Unity's release API
https://services.api.unity.com/unity/editor/release/v1/releases (6.3 LTS first
editor 6000.3.0f1 on Dec 3, 2025; latest 6000.3.26f1 on Oct 8, 2026). Upgrading
the pin is a decision for when 6.7 LTS ships and `/setup-engine` re-pins; until
then new projects stay on 6.3 LTS.

## Unity 6 Releases Before the Cutoff

These two predate the May 2025 cutoff, so they are not post-cutoff. The Knowledge
Gap Warning above still applies to them: treat their APIs as unconfirmed until
checked against this directory.

| Version | Release | Risk Level | Key Theme |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 6.0 LTS | Oct 2024 | HIGH | Unity 6 launch: GPU Resident Drawer, Render Graph for URP, multiplayer workflows, mobile web, new Update release type |
| 6.1 | Apr 2025 | MEDIUM | First Supported Update release: URP Deferred+ path, Variable Rate Shading, Project Auditor, WebGPU for Unity Web, foldable/large-screen Android |
